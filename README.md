# SweetEscape — A Full-Featured Music Player

> "Built with love and passion with JavaScript."

SweetEscape is an original, **Spotify replacement** — a static, full-featured music player made entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
No frameworks. No backend servers. Just pure web magic.

It started as a small Glitch.com project and has since evolved into a fully functional, AI-assisted, Supabase-enabled player — now hosted on **Vercel**.

---

## About the Project

SweetEscape is a **self-contained static website** that:

* Stores all your songs, settings, and playlists **locally** using **Session Storage**, **LocalStorage**, and **IndexedDB**.
* Allows you to **add music manually from YouTube** or **import premade playlists**.
* Doubles as a **karaoke player** and **lyrics transcriber**.
* **AI** enabled playlist generation.
* Tracks **billboard hot-100** charts
* Is designed for **speed, simplicity, and beauty** — with a goal of hitting **1 million visits**. (3800 visits as of 10/16/2025) (7764 visits as of 11/20/2025)

> Once just a fun Glitch experiment, SweetEscape became something much more —
> a full-fledged, privacy-friendly, personal music world that runs entirely in your browser.
